class LastNSplitter(Splitter):
    """
    Splitter for cross-validation by leave-one-out / leave-k-out scheme (recent activity).
    Generate train and test putting last n interactions for each user in test
    and all of his previous interactions in train.
    Cross-validation is achieved with sliding window over each users interactions history.

    This technique may be used for sequential recommendation scenarios.
    It is common in research papers on sequential recommendations.
    But it doesn't fully prevent data leak from the future.

    It is also possible to exclude cold users and items and already seen items.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        Number of interactions for each user that will be included in test.
    n_splits : int, default 1
        Number of test folds.
    filter_cold_users : bool, default ``True``
        If `True`, users that not in train will be excluded from test.
    filter_cold_items : bool, default ``True``
        If `True`, items that not in train will be excluded from test.
    filter_already_seen : bool, default ``True``
        If ``True``, pairs (user, item) that are in train will be excluded from test.
