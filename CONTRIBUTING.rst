Contributing Guide
==================

Welcome! There are many ways to contribute, including submitting bug
reports, improving documentation, submitting feature requests, reviewing
new submissions, or contributing code that can be incorporated into the
project.

Please, don't use the issue tracker for support questions. Instead use:
`email <mars-team@mts.ru>`__.

Feature Requests
----------------

Please create a new GitHub issue for any significant changes and
enhancements that you wish to make. Provide the feature you would like
to see, why you need it, and how it will work. Discuss your ideas
transparently and get community feedback before proceeding.

Significant changes that you wish to contribute to the project should be
discussed first in a GitHub issue that clearly outlines the changes and
benefits of the feature.

Small Changes can directly be crafted and submitted to the GitHub
Repository as a Pull Request.

Pull Request Process
--------------------

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface,
   including new environment variables, proper file
   locations, and container parameters.
2. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two
   other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you
   may request the second reviewer to merge it for you. We expect to
   have a minimum of one approval from someone else on the core team.

Review Process
--------------

We keep pull requests open for a few days for multiple people to have
the chance to review/comment.

After feedback has been given, we expect responses within two weeks.
After two weeks, we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any
activity.
