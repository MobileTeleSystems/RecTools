# Code of Conduct

## Conduct

* We are commited to provide a friendly and welcoming environment for all
* Be kind and resprectful, no need to be rude or mean
* Any design decision or way of implementing carries a trade-off. People have different opinions, and that's ok. There is seldom a right answer. Please respect that
* Keep your critique structured. If you still wish to be unstructured, keep it at minimum
* Insulters will be excluded from interactions
* Harrassment - public or private - is unacceptable, as well as trolling, flaming and baiting. That's all there is to it. No matter who you are

## Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.
